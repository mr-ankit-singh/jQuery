    -Action triggered using keyboard Keys

  * Ther are three keyboard events

    1) keypress()

    -The keypress() method triggers the keypress event, or attaches a function to run when a keypress event occurs.
    -The keypress event is similar to the keydown event. The event occurs when a button is pressed down.

    Synatx :

    -Trigger the keypress event for the selected elements:
        $(selector).keypress()
    -Attach a function to the keypress event:
        $(selector).keypress(function)
