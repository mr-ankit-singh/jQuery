#__ jQuery Events __#

    -All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.
    -An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
    -Examples:
        -moving a mouse over an element
        -selecting a radio button
        -clicking on an element
    -The term "fires/fired" is often used with events


  * Here are some common DOM events:

    Mouse-Events	Keyboard-Events	    Form-Events	    Document/Window Events
    click	            keypress	      submit	        load
    dblclick	        keydown	        change      	  resize
    mouseenter	        keyup	        focus	          scroll
    mouseleave	 	                    blur	          unload
    mouseup
    mousedown
